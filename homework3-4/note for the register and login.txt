Login finction:
 
(1) input username and password:

username = ask the user for username:

password = ask the user for password
 
now we hav eusername and password
 
(2) open accounts.txt and read the file contents:

	#read(), readline(), readlines()

        - look on file reading

	- best approach is to read every line into a list

           ["fredsmart1", "12345678"]

	- extract readlist[0] , readlist[1]
 
        compare username with readlist[0] AND

                password  with realist[1]

        if match : login successful 

        otherwise at end of the loop - Login fails
